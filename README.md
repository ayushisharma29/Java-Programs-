# Java-Programs-
This repo contains all my Java Programs which i have created during my learning period.
During this learning time i have learned about the basic programming concepts in java like variables, Data types, taking input from user, Deeper understanding about Strings( that String is a class in java which have special support that it can be used as a built in data type), Conditional statements, control Statements and arrays.
After the basic concepts i have get to learn about the concepts of Object Oriented programming as java is a object orinented programming language but we can't say that it is a pure object oriented programming language because in java built in datatypes are wrapped inside some wrapper classes whose methods are'nt call by any objects but the name of the wrapper classes itself.
Inside Oops concepts i have learned about Abstraction, encapsulation, method overloading, method overriding, polymorphism, inheritance, packages, I/O Streams and collections etc.
Based on all of these concepts i have created some programs as a practice question which i have included in this repositary.
